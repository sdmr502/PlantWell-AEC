# PlantWell

PlantWell is uses Windows IoT on a Raspberry Pi. The application was intially written in Python but due to making use of ML.net, I decided to re-weite it in C# to bring the capabilities of ML.net directly on the Pi or in Azure. In addition to this my knownledge of OOP in Python is limited which encourage the change to C#

Python version - https://github.com/sdmr502/Automated-Environment-Control-System

The project is still in development but is currently gathering data due to changing the schema structure and physical environment.
